# Tracking 287(g)

This repository tracks the **287(g)** program, which includes both participating and pending law enforcement agencies. The scraper runs daily, extracting data from the official [ICE 287(g) page](https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g). The data is saved in two main folders:

- **`agreements/`**: Contains PDFs of all 287(g) agreements between law enforcement agencies and ICE, categorized by state and agency.
- **`sheets/`**: Stores Excel files listing participating and pending agencies, as published on the ICE website.

## Purpose

Law enforcement agencies are increasingly entering into agreements with ICE under the **287(g)** program, assisting in the deportation of immigrants from across the U.S. This program is supported by mandates like [Louisiana Executive Order Number JML 25-060: Project Geaux](https://interactive.wwltv.com/pdfs/Operation_GEAUX.pdf), which directs state law enforcement agencies to collaborate with ICE. 

As these mandates grow, itâ€™s crucial to track which agencies are involved in the program. This provides a real-time overview of participating agencies and their respective agreements.
